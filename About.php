            <p>Well, there you have it. You've clicked to yet another website filled with Madonna content. Pics, articles, and more memorabilia than you can shake a finger at. But, how did this particular website come together? More importantly, what's up with the Everybody Fanzine? All in due time, my friends. Since it took us <span id="yearsActive"></span> years to get here, I think I can take a little time in giving you the facts. <span id="yearsActiveConfirmation"></span> years? Yep, that's when I started the zine, back in 1991. I was one of the first group of ICON members (my number had four digits!), and I really liked the idea of sharing my enormous Madonna collection with other like-minded fans. Plus, being a writer who can't stop expressing myself might have had something to do with it.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I wrote up my first issue, about 8-10 folded pages, hand-written, and filled it with video reviews, items for sale, and my thoughts and artwork, and it was free. I shared it with friends, family and fellow pen-pals. Soon, I did a few more, and thought to myself: "This is pretty fun!" I was religiously poring over the ads in ICON with each issue, and when I read an ad to help compile great fan stuff for an upcoming book, I was definitely interested! His name was Matthew Rettenmund and the book was Encyclopedia Madonnica. I sent in my little creation for consideration and soon I received a waiver form allowing my work to be used in the book. I was thrilled! When the book was released, there I was, under fanzines, with quite a glowing review. That was the point of no return. Everyone and their brother wrote me for a copy.</p>

              <figcaption class="extra-small-georgia-gray-it" style="text-align: center;">Mariam holding one of her zines.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I decided to rethink my strategy, (so I wouldn't go broke). The zine went full-size and I started typing it, adding more fan content and articles. This was in 1995. From that point on, the zine has flourished in many ways. I have met some of my best friends from it, gone to great events through it, networked and connected with Madonna's manager, and built a great community of Madonna fans through ever-changing technology and trends.</p>
            <p>Which brings us to the present day, and it brings me so much joy to say we are back and for the last <span id="yearsOnFacebook"></span> years we have built a strong community on Facebook. We have grown in numbers and I've also had monthly contests, great content, promotions, and features. We are so excited to have you join us once again for the latest news, pictures, fan features, contests and more. We are looking for your participation and feedback as we grow and continue to evolve. Our journey has been such a great one and we have you to thank for it, because it's all about everybody! Welcome to Everybody Fan Club!</p>
